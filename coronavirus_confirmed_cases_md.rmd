In this notebook I will inspect the evolution of the number of people infected by the COVID-19. 
```{r warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}
## Loading the necessary libraries
library( tidyverse)
library( data.table)

## Data loading and pre-processing
confirmed = as.tbl( fread( "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_19-covid-Confirmed.csv")) # Downloading the data
print( confirmed) # The data has wide format, whereby each date is represented by a column
confirmed = confirmed %>% gather( Date, Confirmed_Cases, -(1:4)) # Melting the data, such that each row corresponds to one region/province in one day
print( confirmed)
confirmed = confirmed %>% mutate( Date = as.Date( Date, format = "%m/%d/%y")) # Casting strings to dates
confirmed = confirmed %>% group_by( `Country/Region`, Date) %>% summarise( Confirmed_Cases = sum( Confirmed_Cases)) %>% ungroup() # Number of diseased people grouped by region and date

confirmed = confirmed %>% rename( Country = `Country/Region`) %>% filter( Country != 'Others')
temp = confirmed %>% filter( Date == max( Date)) %>% mutate( Position = dense_rank( desc( Confirmed_Cases))) %>% select( Country, Position)
confirmed = confirmed %>% inner_join( temp, "Country") %>% filter( Position <= 5)
confirmed = confirmed %>% mutate( Confirmed_Cases = ifelse( Confirmed_Cases == 0, 0.9, Confirmed_Cases)) %>% select( -Position)
head( confirmed)
